Advanced software engineering project (Graphical programming language)

Aim of the project is to produce a simplified environment to teach simple programming concepts. The langauge is similar to BASIC and allows the user to write programs or enter commands to draw onto a canvas.

The language introduces the basics of sequence, selection and iteration.

The project is split into two parts: Assignment 1 - Producing a basic langauge which allows the user to enter commands and Assignment 2 - Adding to this basic language and introducing variables, loops and conditional statements.
